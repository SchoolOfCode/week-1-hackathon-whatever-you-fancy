ESCAPE ROOM PLAN

DREAMER ROOM

Horror, spooky evoking emotion through music  
Really immersive, eg AR  
7 levels (Dante’s inferno: 7 circles of hell?)

* Horror themed \- blood dripping down.  
* Cupboards \+ Doors open to reveal items/ keys.  
* Custom theme tune made by the talented Kit Jones.  
* Custom animations for everything.  
* Being able to walk around the room.  
* Crouch down, lie on the floor.  
* Lift items up.  
* Move items around the room.  
* Jump scares \- (maybe when opening escape door).  
* Intricate tasks.  
* Animated clock / countdown which moves the hands in real-time.

**Realists’ room:**  
Top down view, eerie room full of things that shouldn’t be there  
Click on items, messages will pop up  
Eg locked chests  
Find a key to get out

**Critics room:**  
All to be in first-person view, player is not a sprite (only a pointer to click on things)  
Let’s limit it to 1 level, and use MVPs to get it as close to finished as we can

**OUR VISION FOR LEVEL 1**

Player looks around room, clicks on things.  
At some point, they pick up skull. Skull magnifies. It has 3 scratch marks on it. (Hopefully player realises that ‘3’ is a code.)  
Player finds bookshelf and clicks on a wonky book, which then magnifies. There’s a padlock on it. The player enters ‘3’ and the book opens. There’s a key inside.   
The player ‘picks up’ the key and looks for the door. They have to press a button to change the view, and this reveals the door. They click on it, and that completes the level.

**1st MVP**  
Room with our background for level 1 (includes bookshelf and skull)  
You already have key. (It is displayed in inventory)  
There is a button to press to turn around / change view, which displays a different background with a door. Click the door to win

**2nd MVP**  
Now there is a key in the room, in plain sight   
Click it to “pick up”.   
Message displays saying you have picked up key, and the key disappears from game screen and appears in inventory display as before.  
Now when they find and click the door, the door checks they have key. If they do, they win. If they don’t the door wont open.

**3rd MVP**  
Now instead of a key in the room, the bookshelf is clickable. A message is displayed saying “the code is 3” when the user clicks the bookshelf AND a book with a padlock magnifies. If user enters ‘3’ it reveals key. The rest is as before. 

**4th MVP**  
Now there is no message saying “the code is 3” but there is a skull in the room. When you click it it magnifies and you see 3 scratch marks. (

**5th MVP**  
Same as before, but a baddie pops up randomly. Don’t let your pointer touch it\!  
Baddie is evil girl with long hair over her face and long fingernails.

**6th MVP (enhancements)**  
Items wobble intriguingly when you hover over them

^^^ This one seems to be the best because of the chest….
